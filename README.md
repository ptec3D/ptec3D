- 👋 Hi, I’m @ptec3D aka prawntech3d aka teddlesruss' OTHER other alias, made for this projekt.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning things related to the wide wonderful world of 3D CAD CAM FDM FFF SLS design making building.
      Anything I can to do with desktop manufacturing - adjacent technology, really. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ALL THE THINGS! Not kidding, either - while you'd think that at 60+++++ years I should have 
      learned heaps, all I've learned is that I haven't learned nearly enough... 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with the above. But I do have projects on the burners here, too.
- 📫 How to reach me: prawntech3d@protonmail.com will do nicely. 

- teddlesruss@protonmail.com will also work but using the above helps me sort my baskets.
